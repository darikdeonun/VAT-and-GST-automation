# VAT and GST Automation
[VAT and GST automation](https://taxdo.com/services/global-vat-automation) refers to the use of technology to streamline the calculation, reporting, and filing of indirect taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT) and Goods and Services Tax (GST). These automated systems integrate with accounting, ERP, and e-commerce platforms to apply accurate tax rates based on real-time rules, reduce human error, and ensure compliance with ever-changing local and international tax regulations. By automating these processes, businesses can save time, lower compliance costs, and reduce the risk of penalties or audits, while gaining better visibility into their tax obligations across multiple jurisdictions.
